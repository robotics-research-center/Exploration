THIS FILE PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE PARAMETERS USED IN THE EXPLORE_DIRECTION_ESTIMATOR NODE. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE STEREO_IMAGE_PROC
PARAMETERS USED TO GENERATE POINT CLOUD AND USE IT IN THE NODE  
===========================================================================================================================================


/explore/ground_tol -- This parameter controls the error tolerance for qualifying a point as ground point. It is used when segmenting 
					  obstacles using ground plane segementation.
					  
/explore/obstacle_tol-- Same as above but for obstacles

/explore/grid_size -- Size of the grid - grid is discretized 2D view of the scene with obstacles as 1s and free space as 0s in the grid
					 
/explore/cam_height -- height of the camera from the road

/explore/angular_occupancy_resolution -- the resolution of the angle bins which are used for generating safe directions. 
										
/explore/angular_occupancy_angle_offset -- angle offset from both ends i.e. if we have a camera with 100 degree FOV then the offset 
										  value would be 40. as we make the angular bins from 0-pi only.
										  
/explore/angular_occupancy_max_rho -- The distance from the camera center to consider for generating the angular occupancy. It means that
									  obstacle beyond this distance are not considered for generating the safe gaps.
									  
/explore/min_safe_driving_gap -- the width of the gap to be considered as safe

/explore/plane_fitting_distance_thres -- the tolerance while doing a plane fitting on the road points 
						
/exlore/color_input_cloud -- It takes Boolean value. If true, color codes the points of cloud being published on incoming_point_cloud topic
							 to distinguish obstacle points from ground points
							 
/explore/grid_center_x -- center of the grid in x-axis. It is required when sometimes we want an offset for the grid center and mostly 
						  required when we change the size of the grid in real_time using the grid_size parameter i.e. accordingly the 
						  center has to be changed
						  
/explore/grid_center_z -- same as above but for z-axis. Note that the frame of grid is aligned with the frame of camera and hence we consider
						  X and Z and not Y.
						  
/explore/obstacle_segmentation_method -- method used to segment points as obstacles. 0 - height based , 1 - road plane fitting based

/explore/min_height_for_obstacles -- the height above which the points are considered as obstacles. It is used when working with height based
									 method for obstacle segmentation.
									 
/explore/load_params -- Takes Boolean value and if true loads the changed parameters. Note that when ever you change parameters, you have to load it									 


/explore/max_X_for_plane_fitting -- This and below two parameters define the volume of points to consider for road plane fitting
/explore/max_Y_for_plane_fitting -- 
/explore/max_Z_for_plane_fitting -- 

/explore/marker_z_position_offset -- offset of the z-plane of the marker. In other words it is the offset of marker in height i.e. Z axis in global frame

/explore/vehicle_width -- The width of the vehicle. Used when generating safe angle range for gaps

/explore/min_Z -- This and below parameter is used to trim unnecessary points in point cloud.
/explore/max_Y --


/explore/gap_width_weight  -- Weight of gap width in optimal frontier computation
/explore/gap_dist_weight   -- Weight of gap distance from robot in optimal frontier computation
/explore/angle_diff_weight -- Weight of angle difference (curr-prev) in optimal frontier computation
